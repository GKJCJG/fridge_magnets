# Fridge Magnets

Deployed [here.](https://gkjcjg.github.io/fridge_magnets/)

A friend asked for an app that would allow him to enter words and phrases, have them appear in a sandbox where the could be mouse-dragged around, and drop them off in a trash bin when they were no longer needed. In response, I created this.

## How it works

The app consists of a text entry field, a sandbox, and a trashcan. When text is entered in the entry field, it can be moved into the sandbox with the press of the 'Enter' key. A block of text can be moved to the trashcan, which deletes the `<div>` that contains that text.

## To get it running

The app consists of a single html page with a style tag in the header and a short JS script at the end of the body. Simply open the html file in a browser or click the link above to get the app running.
